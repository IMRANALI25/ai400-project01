# Quadratic Equation: Study Notes

---

## Topic Overview

A quadratic equation is a special type of math equation that involves a variable squared (x^2). It's called "quadratic" because "quad" means square, like a square has four sides. These equations create U-shaped curves called parabolas when graphed, and they're used everywhere in physics, engineering, economics, and everyday life to describe things like projectile motion, profit optimization, and area calculations.

## 1. Remember - Key Facts & Vocabulary

### Key Terms

- **Quadratic Equation**: An equation that can be written in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are numbers and a ≠ 0
- **Variable**: A letter (usually x) that represents an unknown value
- **Coefficient**: A number that multiplies a variable (like a, b, or c in ax^2 + bx + c)
- **Constant**: A number by itself (like c in ax^2 + bx + c)
- **Root**: The value(s) of x that make the equation true (also called solutions or zeros)
- **Parabola**: The U-shaped curve you get when you graph a quadratic equation
- **Vertex**: The lowest or highest point on a parabola
- **Discriminant**: The part of the quadratic formula (b^2 - 4ac) that tells you how many roots exist
- **Factoring**: Breaking an equation into simpler parts that multiply together
- **Standard Form**: ax^2 + bx + c = 0

### Important Facts

- A quadratic equation always has an x^2 term (that's what makes it quadratic)
- The highest power of x is always 2 (never more, never less)
- Quadratic equations can have 0, 1, or 2 solutions
- The graph of any quadratic equation is always a parabola
- If a is positive, the parabola opens up (smile shape)
- If a is negative, the parabola opens down (frown shape)

### Quick Reference

**Standard Form: ax^2 + bx + c = 0**

**Quadratic Formula:**
```
x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
```

**Three Methods to Solve:**
1. Factoring (when possible)
2. Quadratic Formula (always works)
3. Completing the Square (useful for specific cases)

## 2. Understand - Core Concepts

### Main Ideas

Think of a quadratic equation as a special recipe where the main ingredient is something squared. Just like a recipe has specific parts (ingredients, amounts, steps), a quadratic equation has specific parts:

- **ax^2** is the squared part (the "quadratic" part)
- **bx** is the linear part (regular x term)
- **c** is the constant (just a number)

The equation equals zero, which means we're trying to find what value(s) of x make everything balance out to zero.

### How It Works

**The Graph (Parabola):**
When you plot all possible solutions to a quadratic equation on a graph, you get a parabola. This shape appears everywhere in nature:
- Water fountains (water follows a parabolic path)
- Satellite dishes (shaped like parabolas to focus signals)
- Bridges (some arches are parabolic)
- Thrown balls (basketball shots, baseball throws)

**The Roots (Solutions):**
The roots are where the parabola touches or crosses the x-axis. These are the x-values that make the equation equal zero. You can have:
- **Two roots** if the parabola crosses the x-axis twice
- **One root** if it just touches the x-axis at one point
- **No real roots** if it never touches the x-axis at all

### Simple Explanation

Imagine throwing a ball straight up in the air. A quadratic equation can describe the ball's height at any time. The roots tell you when the ball is at height zero (on the ground). You might have two roots: when you first threw it, and when it landed back on the ground. Or one root if you just dropped it and it bounced once. The quadratic formula helps you calculate exactly when these things happen!

### Key Points Summary

- Quadratic equations describe curved relationships (not straight lines)
- The variable is always squared (x^2), which creates the curve
- Solutions tell you where the graph crosses the horizontal axis
- The shape is always a parabola (U-shaped curve)
- Three main methods exist to find the solutions

### Practice Questions (Understand)

1. Explain in your own words why quadratic equations always make curved graphs instead of straight lines.
2. What does it mean when we say a quadratic equation has "no real solutions"?
3. How would you describe the relationship between the graph of a quadratic equation and its roots?

## 3. Apply - Practical Use

### Real-World Examples

1. **Projectile Motion**: When you kick a soccer ball, throw a basketball, or launch a rocket, its path follows a parabola. Quadratic equations calculate exactly where the object will be at any time.

2. **Area Problems**: If you have a fixed amount of fencing (say 20 meters) and want to make a rectangular garden, you can use quadratic equations to find the dimensions that give the maximum area.

3. **Business Profit**: Companies use quadratic equations to find the optimal price for products. For example, selling at too low a price loses money, but selling at too high a price means fewer customers. There's a sweet spot in between that maximizes profit.

4. **Bridges and Architecture**: Engineers use parabolas in bridge designs because they evenly distribute weight. The cables in suspension bridges form parabolic curves.

### How to Solve a Quadratic Equation

**Example: Solve x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0**

**Method 1: Factoring**
1. Write the equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
2. Find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5
3. These numbers are -2 and -3 (because -2 × -3 = 6 and -2 + -3 = -5)
4. Rewrite: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
5. Set each part to zero: x - 2 = 0 OR x - 3 = 0
6. Solve: x = 2 OR x = 3

**Method 2: Quadratic Formula** (for x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0)
1. Identify: a = 1, b = -5, c = 6
2. Plug into formula: x = (5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 2
3. Simplify: x = (5 ± √1) / 2
4. Calculate: x = (5 ± 1) / 2
5. Two solutions: x = 6/2 = 3 OR x = 4/2 = 2

### Practice Application

**Exercise 1**: Find where the ball hits the ground
If a ball's height is given by h = -16t^2 + 64t (where t is time in seconds), when does it hit the ground?

**Solution**:
1. Ground means height = 0, so: -16t^2 + 64t = 0
2. Factor out -16t: -16t(t - 4) = 0
3. Set each part to zero: -16t = 0 OR t - 4 = 0
4. Solve: t = 0 OR t = 4
5. The ball is on the ground at t = 0 (when thrown) and t = 4 (when it lands)

**Exercise 2**: Maximize area
You have 20 meters of fencing to make a rectangular garden against a wall (so you only need 3 sides). What dimensions give maximum area?

**Solution**:
1. Let width = w, then length = 20 - 2w
2. Area = w × (20 - 2w) = 20w - 2w^2
3. This is quadratic! The vertex gives the maximum
4. Using vertex formula or completing the square: w = 5
5. Dimensions: 5m wide × 10m long = 50m^2 maximum area

### Practice Questions (Apply)

1. Solve x^2 - 9 = 0 using factoring.
2. Apply the quadratic formula to solve 2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0.
3. A ball is thrown upward with the equation h = -16t^2 + 80t. When does it reach maximum height and what is that height?

## 4. Analyze - Deeper Understanding

### Breaking It Down

**The Three Parts of a Quadratic:**

Each part of ax^2 + bx + c affects the graph differently:

- **a (the x^2 coefficient)**: Controls the width and direction
  - Larger |a| = narrower parabola
  - Smaller |a| = wider parabola
  - Positive a = opens up (smile)
  - Negative a = opens down (frown)

- **b (the x coefficient)**: Controls the horizontal position of the vertex
  - Shifts the parabola left or right
  - Affects where the axis of symmetry is

- **c (the constant)**: Controls the vertical position
  - Moves the parabola up or down
  - This is where the graph crosses the y-axis

### Comparisons

| Aspect | Linear Equation | Quadratic Equation |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Form | y = mx + b | y = ax^2 + bx + c |
| Graph | Straight line | Parabola (curve) |
| Power of x | x¹ | x^2 |
| Solutions | At most 1 solution | 0, 1, or 2 solutions |
| Rate of change | Constant | Always changing |
| Example | y = 2x + 3 | y = x^2 - 4x + 3 |

**Key insight**: Linear equations show steady, constant change. Quadratic equations show accelerated or decelerated change—the rate of change itself is changing!

### Relationships

**The Discriminant and Number of Roots:**

The discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) tells you how many roots exist without solving:

- **Positive discriminant**: 2 real roots (parabola crosses x-axis twice)
- **Zero discriminant**: 1 real root (parabola touches x-axis at one point)
- **Negative discriminant**: 0 real roots (parabola never touches x-axis)

**Example Analysis:**
- x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 → discriminant = 16 - 12 = 4 (positive) → 2 roots
- x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 → discriminant = 16 - 16 = 0 (zero) → 1 root
- x^2 - 4x + 5 = 0 → discriminant = 16 - 20 = -4 (negative) → 0 roots

### Patterns and Trends

**Perfect Square Trinomials:**
Some quadratics factor perfectly:
- x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x + 1)^2
- x^2 + 4x + 4 = (x + 2)^2
- x^2 - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)^2

**Pattern**: If (b/2)^2 = c, then you have a perfect square!

**Difference of Squares:**
- x^2 - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)
- x^2 - 25 = (x + 5)(x - 5)
- x^2 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1)

**Pattern**: x^2 - a^2 = (x + a)(x - a)

### Practice Questions (Analyze)

1. What are the parts of a quadratic equation and how does each affect the graph?
2. Analyze the relationship between the discriminant and the number of solutions.
3. How is a quadratic equation related to a linear equation? What patterns do you see in their differences?

## 5. Evaluate - Critical Thinking

### Strengths and Benefits

**Why Quadratic Equations Are Powerful:**

- **Model Real-World Curves**: Many natural phenomena follow curved patterns, not straight lines. Gravity, profit optimization, and area problems all need quadratics.
- **Predict Future Values**: Once you have the equation, you can predict values at any point (past or future).
- **Find Optimal Solutions**: The vertex gives maximum or minimum values instantly useful for optimization problems.
- **Multiple Methods**: You can choose factoring, formula, or completing the square depending on what's easiest.

**The Quadratic Formula is Universal**:
- Works for EVERY quadratic equation
- No need to be clever or lucky with factoring
- Reliable and systematic

### Limitations and Considerations

**When Quadratics Don't Work:**
- **Complex Roots**: Sometimes the discriminant is negative, giving imaginary roots that don't exist on the real number line
- **Not All Curves**: Some curves are cubic (x^3), exponential, or other types
- **Sensitivity**: Small changes in coefficients can dramatically change the solutions

**Computational Complexity:**
- The quadratic formula requires multiple steps
- Easy to make arithmetic errors
- Square roots can give messy decimal answers

**Real-World Simplification:**
- Most real problems are more complex than simple quadratics
- Many approximations are needed to fit real data into quadratic form
- Air resistance, friction, and other factors often complicate the model

### Different Perspectives

**Mathematician's View**: Quadratic equations are beautiful because they're the simplest equations that create curves. They're the foundation for understanding more complex mathematics.

**Engineer's View**: Quadratic equations are practical tools for optimization and design. They help find the best solution within constraints.

**Student's View**: Quadratic equations can feel confusing at first, but they follow predictable patterns. Once you practice, they become manageable.

### Evaluation Criteria

When choosing a method to solve a quadratic equation, consider:

1. **Is it factorable?** If yes, factoring is usually fastest
2. **Are the numbers "nice"?** If you see perfect squares, try factoring first
3. **Do you need exact or approximate answers?** Formula gives exact, but decimals might be more practical
4. **Is completing the square easier?** Sometimes useful when a = 1 and b is even

### Practice Questions (Evaluate)

1. What are the pros and cons of using the quadratic formula versus factoring?
2. Evaluate this statement: "Quadratic equations are the most useful type of equation in the real world."
3. Would you recommend teaching factoring or the quadratic formula first? Why?
