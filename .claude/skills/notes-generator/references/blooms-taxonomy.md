# Bloom's Taxonomy Reference Guide

Complete reference for generating educational notes following Bloom's Taxonomy framework.

## Overview

Bloom's Taxonomy is a hierarchical model used to classify educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. It progresses from lower-order thinking skills (LOTS) to higher-order thinking skills (HOTS).

## The Six Levels of Bloom's Taxonomy

### Level 1: Remember (Knowledge)

**Definition**: Recall facts and basic concepts

**Key Verbs**: list, identify, define, name, recall, recognize, match, locate, label, state

**Sample Questions**:
- What is...?
- When did... happen?
- Where is...?
- Who were the main...?
- List the...
- Define the term...
- Identify the...

**Content Examples**:
- Key terms and vocabulary
- Important dates, names, places
- Basic facts and figures
- Definitions of concepts
- Lists of items

### Level 2: Understand (Comprehension)

### Level 5: Evaluate (Evaluation)

**Definition**: Justify a stand or decision

**Key Verbs**: evaluate, judge, assess, critique, justify, defend, argue, recommend, rate, validate

**Sample Questions**:
- What is your opinion about...?

### Level 6: Create (Synthesis)

**Definition**: Produce new or original work

**Key Verbs**: create, design, develop, construct, plan, produce, invent, formulate, compose, generate

**Sample Questions**:
- How would you design a...?
- Create a plan for...

- Design a solution for...
- What would happen if...?
- Invent a new way to...

**Content Examples**:
- Creative project ideas
- Design challenges
- Innovation opportunities
- New combinations of ideas
- Original solutions

## Progression Through Levels

When generating notes, follow this natural progression:

1. **Foundation** (Remember) - Establish baseline knowledge
2. **Comprehension** (Understand) - Ensure meaning is clear
3. **Application** (Apply) - Connect to practical use
4. **Analysis** (Analyze) - Examine deeper relationships
5. **Critique** (Evaluate) - Make informed judgments
6. **Innovation** (Create) - Develop new ideas

## Writing Notes by Bloom's Level

### Remember-Level Notes
- Focus on facts, definitions, lists
- Use clear headings for key terms
- Include vocabulary lists
- Provide concise summaries
- Use bullet points for easy memorization

### Understand-Level Notes
- Explain concepts in simple language
- Provide examples and analogies
- Use comparisons to clarify
- Include simple summaries
- Restate complex ideas simply

### Apply-Level Notes
- Include step-by-step procedures
- Provide real-world examples
- Show how to use the knowledge
- Include practical exercises
- Demonstrate applications

### Analyze-Level Notes
- Break down complex topics
- Compare and contrast ideas
- Show relationships between concepts
- Use diagrams and charts
- Identify patterns

### Evaluate-Level Notes
- Present different perspectives
- Include evaluation criteria
- Show pros and cons
- Provide critical thinking questions
- Support judgments with evidence

### Create-Level Notes
- Suggest project ideas
- Provide design prompts
- Encourage innovation
- Include synthesis activities
- Present open-ended challenges

## Language Guidelines

**Keep language simple and accessible:**
- Avoid jargon or explain technical terms
- Use short, clear sentences
- Provide examples for abstract concepts
- Use analogies to make connections
- Define new terms when first introduced
- Check reading level (aim for 8th-10th grade readability)

## Question Patterns for Practice Questions

Generate practice questions for each level using these patterns:

| Level | Question Starters |
|-------|-------------------|
| Remember | What is...? List the... Who...? When...? Define... |
| Understand | Explain... What does... mean? Summarize... Describe... |
| Apply | How would you use...? Apply... to... Demonstrate... |
| Analyze | What are the parts of...? Analyze... Compare... and... |
| Evaluate | Evaluate... What are the pros and cons...? Justify... |
| Create | Design... Create... Develop... How would you improve...? |
